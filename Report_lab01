#Report 1: It still technically works, however, the half pyramid has too many
#characters now on each level and looks funny.

#Report 2: Much like the first half pyramid, the full pyramid goes through the
#same glitch where the characters simply repeat and make an sort of 'double'
#pyramid on every level.
